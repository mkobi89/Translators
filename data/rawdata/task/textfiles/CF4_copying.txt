Text 2, Satz 5
In our paper we speculalte that environmental values represent an important source of heterogeneity in the effect of the Opower peer comparison.

Text 2, Satz 6
While the conservation behaviour of people with high biospheric values has been largely studied in the literature, little is known about the response of these individuals to peer comparison.

Text 2, Satz 7
In this paper we test the effect of social comparison on energy conservation and whethrt this depends on the extent to which individuals endorse high environmental values.

Text 2, Satz 8
Anothe important gap in research is the understanding of mechanisms behind individuals' reaction to the Opower Home Energy Report (HER) in the field of energy use.

Text 2, Satz 9
The HER delivers different elements, from a static neighbour comparison on energy consumption (descriptive norm), to feedbacks on how well an individual is performing (injunctive norm), as well as energy s

With this in mind, the project reported here (funded by the EU Commission under Grant Agreement no. 12345), of which the Energy Consumption Research Institute is a partner, aims to uncover best practices and recommendations to address energy poverty.

Text 3, Satz 5
It does so by implementing a series of pilot actions with a group of advisors called HEAs (Home Energy Advisors).

Text 3, Satz 6
These advisors have been specifically trained to implement the pilot actions by educating vulnerable consumers to optimize, and possibly reduce, their energy consumption, mostly through behavioural changes.

Text 3, Satz 7
In this project, the Energy Consumption Research Institute is responsible for the technical training of HEAs and for planning the polpt actions.

Text 3, Satz 8
This paper presents the initial results of these two tasks.

The first part of the paper summarizes the results of a statistical analysis performed in ord
