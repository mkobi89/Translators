Text 2, Satz 4
In particular, relatively little is known about the sources of heterogeneity in the effect of a well-known experiment of social comparison, such as the one provided by the Opower program through the Home Electricity Report.

Text 2, Satz 5
In our paper we speculate that environmental values represent an important source of heterogeneity in the effect of the Opower peer comparison.

Text 2, Satz 6
While the conservation behaviour of people with high biospheric values has been largely studied in the literature, little is known about the response of these individuals to peer comparison.

Text 2, Satz 7
In this paper we test the effect of social comparison on energy conservation and whether this depends on the extent to which individuals endorse high environmental values.

Text 2, Satz 8
Another important gap in research is the understanding of the mechanisms behind individuals reaction to the Opower Home Energy Report (HER) in the field of energy use.

Text 2, Satz 9
The HER delivers different elements, from a static neighbour comparison on energy 

Text 3, Satz 1
Energy poverty is one of the main social, technical and legislative issues at the present time in Europe, with the estimated number of people who are affected ranging from 50 to 125 million.

Text 3, Satz 2
The European Commission (EC) has put a great deal of effort into solving this issue, as shown, for example, by the recent launch of the EU Energy Poverty Observatory in January 2018.

Text 3, Satz 3
One of the points stressed by the EC is the importance of learning from experience and from the best practices being carried out in various member states (MS).

Text 3, Satz 4
With this in mind, the project reported here (funded by the EU Commission under Grant Agreement no. 12345), of which the Energy Consumption Research Institute is a partner, aims to uncover best practices and recommendations to address energy poverty.

Text 3, Satz 5
It does so by implementing a series of pilot actions with a group of advisors called HEAs (Home Energy Advisors).

Text 3, Satz 6
These advisors have been specifically trained to implement the pilot actions
