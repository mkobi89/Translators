Text 1, Satz 2
For example, research indicates that telling people how their actions compare with those of other, similar people encourages them to modify their energy and water consumption, their contributions to charitable causes, and their savings decisions.

Text 1, Satz 3
Despite a growing interest in social comparison research, though, several questions remain open.

Text 1, Satz 4
In particular, relatively little is known about the sources of the heterogeneity observed in the effects of classic social comparison experiments, such as Opower's Home Electricity Report (HER) program.

Text 1, Satz 5
In our paper, we hypothesize that an important source of the heterogenous effects observed in the Opower peer comparison might be consumers' environmental values.

Text 1, Satz 6
While the conservation behaviour of people with high biospheric values has been well- documented in the literature, little is known about these consumers' responses to peer comparison.

Text 1, Satz 7
In this paper, we test whether there is an effect of social comparison on energy conservation and whether this effect depends on the extent to which individuals endorse high environmental values.

Text 1, Satz 8
Another important gap in resarch is the understanding of the mechanisms behind individuals

Text 4, Satz 5
Such advisors are specifically trainer to implement the pilot actions by educating energy vulnerable consumers (VCs) to optmize (and, posibly, reduce) their energy consumption, mostly through behavioural changes.

Text 4, Satz 6
In the project, Energy Consumption Research Institute is responsible of the technical training of HEAs and the pilot actions planning.

Text 4, Satz 7
This paper collects the firs results of the above mentioned task.

Text 4, Satz 8
The first part of the paper summarizes the results of a statistical analysis performed to understand how to define an "energy poor" or "energy vulnerable" consumer, as a common European deifinition does not exist.

Text 4, Satz 9
The main obstacle is performing thi analysis is that the data often used for standard indicators (e.g. Low-Inome High-Costsare not available in manby countries, so new ways to understand what is an "energy vulnerable consumer" have to be explored.

Text 4, Satz 10
Moreover, the availability of different data in the EU countries lead to a fragmented and often "not compatible" segmentation in different Member States.

Text 4, Satz 11
To overcome this barrier, it is necessary to define the background in which the pilot actions shall be inserted (the situation in the analysed MS) andto perform an on -purpose segmenetationm b
