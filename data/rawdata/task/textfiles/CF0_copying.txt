This paper presents the initial results of these two tasks.

Text 3, Satz 9
The frst part of the paper summarizes the results of a statistical analysis performed in order to define "energy-poor" or "energy-vulnerable" consumers, as a common European definition does not exist.

Text 3, Satz 10
The main obstacle in performing this analysis is that the data often used for standard indicators (e.g. Low Income High Costs) are not available in many countries, so new ways to define energy-vulnerable consumers have to be explored.

Text 3, Satz 11

To overcome this barrier, it is necessary to define the background against which the pi
