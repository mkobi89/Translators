Text 2, Satz 5
In our paper we speculate that environmentl values represent an important source of heterogeneity in the effect of the Opower peer comparison.

Text 2, Satz 6
While the conservation behaviour of people with high biospheric values has been largely studied in th literature, little is known about the response of these individuals to peer comparison.

Text 2, Satz 7
In this paper we test the effect of social comparison on energy conservation and whether this depends on the extent to which individuals endorse high environmental values,

Text 2, Satz 8
Another important gap in research is the understanding of the mechanisms behind individuals' reaction to the Opower Home Energy Report (HER) in the field of energy use.

Text 2, Satz 9
The HER dlivers fifferent elements, from a static neighbor comparison on enerygy consumption (descriptive norm), to feedbacks on how well an individual is peforming (injunctive norm), as well as energy saving 

Text 3, Satz 5
It does so by implementing a series of pilot actions with a group of advisors calles HEAs (Home Energy Advisors).

Text 3, Satz 6
These advisors have been specifically trained to implement the pilot actions by educating vulnerable consumers to optimize, and possibly reduce, their energyconsumption, mostly through behavioural changes.

Text 3, Satz 7
In this project, the Energy Consumption Research Institute is responsible for the technical training of HEAs and for planning the pilot actions.

Text 3, Satz 8
This paper presents the initial results of these two tasks.

Text 3, Satz 9
The first part ofthe paper summarizes the results of a statistical analysis performed in order to define "energy-poor" or "energy-vulnerable" consumers, as a common European definition does not exist.

Text 3, Satz 10
The main obstacle in perfoming this analysis is that data often used for standard indicato
