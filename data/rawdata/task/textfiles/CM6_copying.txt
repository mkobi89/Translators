Text 2, Satz 1
The influence of social information on behaviour has been demonstrated in a variety of settings.

Text 2, Satz 2
Research shows that telling people how their actions compare with those of similar others leads them to modify their energy and water consumption, their contributions to charitable causes, and their saving decisions.

Text 2, Satz 3
Despite growing interest in social comparion research, several open questions remain.

Text 2, Satz 4
In particular, relatively little is known about the sources of heterogeneity in the effect of a well-known experiment of social comparison, suh as the one provided by the Opower program through the Home Electricity Report.

Text 2, Satz 5
In our paper we speculate that environmental values represent an important source of heteogeneity in the effect of the Opower peer comparison.

Text 2, Satz 6
While the conservation behaviour of people with high biospheric values has been largely studied in literautre, little is known about the response of these individuals to peer comparison.

Text 2, Satz 7
In this paper we test the effect of social comparison on energy conservation and whether this depends on the extent to which individuals endorse high environmental values.

Text 2, Satz 8
Another important gap in research is the understanding of the machanisms behind individuals'" reaction to the Opower Home Energy Report (HER) in the field of energy use.

Text 2, Satz 9
The HER delivers different elements, from a static

Text 3, Satz 5
It does so by implementing a series of pilot actions with a group of advisors called HEAs (home Energy Advisors).

Text 3, Satz 6
These advisors have been specifically trained to implement the pilot actions by educating vulnerable consumers to optimize, and possibly reduce, their energy consumption, mostly through behavioural changes.

Text 3, Satz 7
In this project, the Energy Consumption Research Institute is responsible for the technical training of HEAs and for planning the pilot actions.

Text 3, Satz 8
This paper presents the initial results of these two tasks.

Text 3, Satz 9
The first part of the paper summarizes the results of a statistical analysis performed in order to define "energy-poor" or "energy-vulnerable" consumers. as a common European definition does not exist.

Text 3, Satz 10
The main obstacle in performing this analysis is that the data often used for standard indicators (e.g. Low Income High Costs) are not available in many countries, sonew ways to define energy-vulberable consumers have to be explored.

Text 3, Satz 11
Moreover, the differences in the data available in the EU countries lead to fragmented and often incompatible consumer segmentation in the member states.

Text 3, Satz 12
To overcome this barrier, it is necessarty to define the background against which the pilot actions are to be implemented (the situation in the MS analysed) and to perform a targeted market segmentation by analyzing and ehancing existing databases to which similar and compatible indicators are applicable.
