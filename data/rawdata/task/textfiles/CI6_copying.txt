Text 1, Satz 1
The influence of social information on behaviour has been demonstrated in a variety of settings. 

Text 1, Satz 2
For example, research indicates that telling people how their actions compare with those of other, similar people encourages them to modify their energy and water consumption, their contributions to charitable causes, and their savings decisios.

Text 1, Satz 3
Despite a growing interest in social comparison research, though, several questions remain open.

Text 1, Satz 4
In particular, relatively little is known about the sources of the heterogeneity observed in the effects of classic social comparison experiments, such as Opowet's Home Electricity Report (HER) program.

Text 1, Satz 5
In our paper, we hypothesize that an important source of the heterogeneous effects observed in the Opower peer comparison might be consumers' environmental values. 

Text 1, Satz 6
While the conservation behaviour of people with hight biospheric values has been well-documented in the literature, little is known about these consumers' responses to peer comparison.

Text 1, Satz 7
In this paper, we test whethr there is an effect of social comparison on energy conservation and whether this effect depends on the extent to which individuals endorse high environmental values.

Text 1, Satz 8
Another important gap in research is the understanding of the mechanisms behind individuals'" reactions to Opower'"s HER with regard to their energy use. 

Text 1, Satz 9
The HER contains different elements, including a static neighbour comparison of energy consumption levels (a descriptive nor), feed

Text 4, Satz 1
Energy Poverty is one of the main social, technical and legislative issues of the present time in Europe, with an estimated number of affected people ranging from 50 to 125 million. 

Text 4, Satz 2
The European Commission (EC) has put a lot of effort to solve this issue, as shown, for example, by the recent launch of the EU Energy Poverty Observatory in January 2018.

Text 4, Satz 3
One of the points stressed by the EC is the importance to learn from the experiences and best practices carried out in the different Member States (MS).

Text 4, Satz 4
With this in mind, the project (funded by the EU Commission under Grant Agreement n. 12345), of which Energy Consumption Research Institute is a partner, aims to find some best practices and recommendations to address Energy Poverty from the implementation of a series of pilot actions with  a group of advisors (called HEAs - Home Energy Advisors. 

Text 4, Satz 5
Such advisors are specifically trained to implement the pilot actions by educating energy vulnerable consumers (VCs) to optimize (and, possible, reduce) their energy consumption, mostly through behavioural changes. 

Text 4, Satz 6
In the project, Energy Consumption Research Institute is responsible of the technical training of HEAs and the pilot actions planning.

Text 4, Satz 7
This paper collects the first results of the above mentioned tasks.

The first part of the paper summarizes the results of a
