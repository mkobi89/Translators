Text 2, Satz 5
In our paper we speculate that environmental values represent an important source of heterogeneity in the effect of the Opower peer comparison.

Text 2, Satz 6
While the conservation behaviour of people with high biospheric values has been largely studied in the literature, little is known about the response of these individuals to peer comparison.

Text 2, Satz 7
In this paper we test the effect of social comparison on energy conservation and whether this depends on the extent to which individuals endorse high environmental values.

Text 2, Satz 8
Another important gap in research is the understanding of the mechanisms behind individuals reaction to the Opower Home Energy Report (HER) in the field of energy use.

Text 2, Satz 9
The HER delivers different elements, from a static neighbour comparison on energy consumption (descriptive norm), to feedbacks on how well an individual is performing (injunctive norm), as well as energy saving tips.

Text 2, Satz 10
A second objektive of this paper is to test possible mechanisms that make the HER effective

Text 2, Satz 11
First, we test if the HER shapes individuals perceptions of the norm in the domain of energy conservation-

Text 2, Satz 12
A stronger perception of the norm in the direction of energy conservatin may then

Text 3, Satz 1
Energy povety is  one of the main social, technical and legislative issues at the present time in Europe, with the estimated number of people who are affected ranging from 50 to 125 million.

Text 3, Satz 2
The Europen Commission (EC) has put a great deal of effort into solving this issue, as shown, for example, by the recent launch of the EU Energy Poverty Observatory in January201.

Text 3, Satz 3
One of the points stressed by the EC is the  importance of learning from experience and from the best practices being carried out in various
