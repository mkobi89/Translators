Text 1, Satz 3
Despite a growing interest in social comparison research, though, several questions remain open.

Text 1, Satz 4
In particular, relatively little is knwon about the sources of the heterogeneity observed in the effects of classical social comparison experiments, such as Opower's Home Electricity Report (HER) program.

Text 1, Satz 5
In our paper, we hypothesize that an important source of the heterogeneous effects observed in the Opower peer comparison might be consumer's evironmental values.

Text 1, Satz 6
While the conservation behaviour of people with high biospheric values has been well- documented in the literature, little is known about htese consumers' response to peer comparison.

Text 1, Satz 7
In this paper, we test whether there is an effect of social comparison on energy conservation and whether this effect depends on the extent to which indivudals endorese high environmental values.

Text 1, Satz 8
Another important gap in research is the understanding of the mechanisms behind individuals' reactions to Opower's HER with regard to their eergy

Text 4, Satz 5
Such advisors are specifically trained to implement the pilot actions by educating energy vulnerable consumers (VCs) to optimize (and, possibly, reduce) their energy consumption, mostly through behavioural changes.

Text 4, Satz 6
In the project, Energy Consumption Research Institute is resposnible of the technical training of HEAs and the pilot actions planning.

Text 4, Satz 7
This paper collects the first results of the above mentioned tasks.

Text 4, Satz 8
The first part of the paper summarizes the results of a statistical analysis performed to understand how to define an '"energy poor'" pr '"energy vulnerable'"consumer, as a common European definiton does not exist.

Text 4, Satz 9
The main obstacle in performing this analysis is that the data often used for standard indicators (e.g. Low-Income High-Costs) are not available in many countries, so new ways to understand what is an '"energy vulnerable consumer'" have to be explored.

Text 4, Satz 10
Moreover, the availability of different data in the EU countries leads to a fragmented and often '"not compatible'" segmentation in different Member States.

Text 4, Satz 11
To overcome this barrier,
