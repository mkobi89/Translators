Text 2, Satz 5
In our Paper we speculate that environmental values represent an important sources of heterogenity in the effect of the Opower peer comparison.

Text 2, Satz 6
While the conversation behavior of people with high biospheric values has been largely studied in the literature, little is known about the response of the individuals to peer comparison.

Text 2, Satz 7
in this paper we test the effect of sociaö comparison on energy conversation and wheter this depends on the extent to whcih individuals endorse high environmental values.

Text 2, Satz 8
Another important gap in research is the understanding of the mechanisms behind individuals' reaction to the Opower Home Energy Report (HER) in the field of energy use.

Text 2, Satz 9
The HER delivers different elements, from a static neighbour comparison on energy consumption (descriptive norm), to feedback

Text 3, Satz 5
It does so by implementing a series of pilot actions with a group of advisors called HEAs (Home Energy Advisors).

Text 3, Satz 6
These advisors have been specifically trained to implement the pilot actions by educating vulnerable consumers to optimize, and possibly reduce, their energy consumption, mostly through behavioral changes-

Text 3, Satz 8
This paper presents the initial results of these two tasks,

Text 3, Satz 9
The first part of the paper summarizes the results of a statistical analysis performed in order to definde "energy-poor" or "energy-vulnerbale" consumers, as a common European definition does not exist.

Text 3, Satz 10
The main obstacle in performing this analysis is that the data often used for standard indicators (e.g. Low
