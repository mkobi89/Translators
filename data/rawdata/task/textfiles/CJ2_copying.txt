Text 2, Satz 5
Ino ur paper we speculate that environmental values represent an important source of heterogeneity in the effect of the Opower peer comparison.

While the conservation Behaviour of people with high biospheric values has been largely studied in the literature, little is known about the response of these individuals to peer comparison.

It does so by implementing a series of pilot actions with a group of advisors called HEAs (Home Energy Advisors).

Text 3, Satz 6
These advisors have been specfically trained to implement the pilot actions by educating vulnerable consumers to optimize, andpossibly recuce, their energy consumption, mostly through behavioural changes.
