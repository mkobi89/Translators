Text 1, Satz 1
The influence of social information on behaviour has been demonstrated in a variety of settings.

Text 1, Satz 2
For example, research indicates that telling people how their actions compare with those of other, similar people encourages them to modify their energy and water consumption, their contributions to charitable causes, and their savings decisions.

Text 1, Satz 3
Despite a growing interest in social comparison research, though, several questions remain open.

Text 1, Satz 4
In particular, relatively little is known about the sources of the heterogeneity observed in the effects of classic social comparison experiments, such as Opower's Home Electricity Report (HER) program.

Text 1, Satz 5
In our paper, we hypothesize that an important source of the heterogeneous effects observed in the Opower peer comparison might be consumers' environmetal values.

Text 1, Satz 6
While the conservation behaviour of people with high biospheric values has been well-documented in the literature, little is known about these consumers' responses to peer comparison.

In this paper, we test whether there is an e

Text 4, Satz 1
Energy Poverty is one of the main social, technical and legislative issues of the present time in Europe, with an estimated number of affected people ranging from 50 to 125 million.

Text 4, Satz 2
The European Commission (EC) has put a lot of effort to solve this issue, as shown, for example, by the recent launch of the EU Energy Poverty Observaory in January 2018.

Text 4, Satz 3
One the points stressed by the EC is the importance to learn from the experiences and best practices carried out in the different Members states (MS).

Text 4, Satz 4
With this in mind, the project (funded by EU Comission under Grant Agreement n. 12345), of which Energy Consumption Research Institute is a partner, aims to find some best practices and recommendations to address Energy Poverty from the implementation of a series of pilot actions with a group of advisors (called HEAs - Home Energy Advisors). Wit

Text 4, Satz 5
Such advisors are specifically trained to implement the pilot actions by educating energy vulnerable consumers (VCs) to optimize (and, possibly, reduce) their energy conumption, mostly through behav
