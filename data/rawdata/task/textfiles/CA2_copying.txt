Text 2, Satz 5
In our paper we speculate that environmental values represent an importat source of heterogeneity in the effect of the Opower peer

Text 3, Satz 5
It does so by implementing a series of pilot actions with a group of advisors called HEAs (Home Energy Advisors)

Text 3, Satz 6
These advisors have been specifically trained to implement the pilot actions by educating vulnerable consumers to optimize, and possibly reduce, their energy consumption, mostly through behavioural changes.

Text 3, Satz 7
In this project, the Energy Consumptions Research Institute is responsible for the technical training of HEAs and for planning the pilot actions.

Text 3, Satz 8
This paper presents the initial results of these two tasks.

Text 3, Satz 9
The first part of the paper summarizes the results of a statistical analysis performed in order to define "energy-poor
