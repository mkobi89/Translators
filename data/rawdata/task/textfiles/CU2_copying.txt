Text 2, Satz 7
In this paper we test the effect of social comparison on energy conservation and whether this depends on th extent to which individuals endorse high environmetal values.

Text 2, Satz 8
Another important gap in research is the understandingof the mechanisms behind individuals' reaction to the Opower Home Energy Report (HER) in the field f energy use.

Text 2, Satz 9
The HER delivers different elements, from a static neighbou comparison on energy consumption (descriptive norm), to feedbacks on how well an individual is performing (injunctive norm), as well as energy saving tips.

Text 2, Satz 10
A second objective of this paper is to test possible mechanisms that make the HER effective.

Text 2, Satz 11
First, we test if the HER shapes individuals' perceptions of the norm n the domain of energy conservation.

Text 2, Satz 12
A stronger perception of the norm in the direction of energy conservation may then influence energy consumption.

Text 2, Satz 13
Second, while environmental values tend to be stable in everyone's life, environmental self-identity can be influenced, for example, through information regarding energy conservation.

Text 2, Satz 14
A second mechanism could therefore be that the information delivered in the HER increases one's environmetal self-identity.

Text 2, Satz 15
By activating biospheric values, the HER strengthens peopleps focus on benefiting the environment.

Text 2, Satz 16
The analysis combines data from a large randomized program conducted by Opower in Italy, with survey data collected among utility customers.

Text 2, Satz 17
The data vailable from the ulitity details whether a person receives the social information through the Home Energy Report, the freuency and type of social info

Text 3, Satz 4
With this in mind, the project reported here (funded by the EU Commission under Grant Agreement no. 12345), of which the Energy Consumption Research Institute is a partner, aims to uncover best practices and recommendations to address energy poverty.

Text 3, Satz 5
It does so by implementing a series of pilot actions with a group of advisors called HEAs (Home Energy Advisors).

Text 3, Satz 6
These advisors have been specifically trained to implement the pilot actions by educating vulnerable consumers to optimize, and possible rduce, their energy consmption, mostly through behavioural changes.

Text 3, Satz 7
In this project, the Energy Consumption Research Institute is responsible for the technical training of HEAs and for planning the pilot actions.

Text 3, Satz 8
This paper presents the initial results of these two tasks.

Text 3, Satz 9
The first part of the paper summarizes the results of a statistical analysis performed in order to define "energy-poor" or "energy-vulnerable" consumers, as a common European definition does not exist.

Text 3, Satz 10
The main obstacle in performing this analysis is that the data often used for standard indicators (e.g. Low Income High Costs) re not available in many countries, so new ways to define energy-vulnerable consumers have to be explored.

Text 3, Satz 11
Moreover, the differences in the data available in EU countries lead to fragmented and often incompatible consumer segmentation in the member states.

Text 3, Satz 12
To overcome this barrier, it is necessary to define the background against which the pilot actions are to
