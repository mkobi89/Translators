Text 1, Satz 5
In our paper, we hypothesize that an important source of the heterogeneous effects observed in the Opower peer comparson might be consumers' environmental values.

Text 1, Satz 6
While the conservation behaviour of people with high biospheric values has been well- documented in the literature, little is known about these consumers' responses to peer comparison.

Text 1, Satz 7
In this paper, we test whether there is an effort of social comparison on energy conservation and whether this effect depends on the extent to which individuals endorse high environmental values.

Text 1, Satz 8
Another important gap in research is the understanding of the mechanisms behind individuals' reactions to Opower's HER with regard to their energy use.

Text 1, Satz 9
The HER contains different elements, including a static neighbour comparison of energy consumption levels (a descriptive norm), feedback n individual performance (an injunctive norm), as well as energy saving tips.

Text 1, Satz 10
A further objective of this paper is to assess possible mechanisms to make th HER more effective.

Text 1, Satz 11
First, we test whether the HER shapes individuals' perceptions of norms in the domain of energy conservation.

Text 1, Satz 12
A stronger perception of the norm to conserve energy may then influence energy  consumptio

Text 4, Satz 5
Such advisors are specifically trained to implement the pilot actions by educating energy vulnerable consumers (VCs) to optimize (and, possibly, reduce) their energy consumption, mostly through behavioural changes.

Text 4, Satz 6
In the project, Energy Consumption Research Institute is responsible of the technical training of HEAs and the pilot actions planning.

Text 4, Satz 7
This paper collects the first results of the above mentined tasks.

Text 4, Satz 8
The first part of the paper summarizes the results of a statistical analysis performed to understand how to define an "energy poor" or "energy vulnerable" consumer, as a common European definition does not exist.

Text 4, Satz 9
The main obstacle in performing this analysis is that the data often used for standard indicators (e.g. Low-Income High-Costs) are not available in many countries, so new ways to understand what is an "energy vulnerable consumer" have to be explored.

Text 4, Satz 10
Moreover, the availability of different data in the EU countries leads to a fragmented and often "not compatible" segmentation in different Member States.

Text 4, Satz 11
To overcome this barrier, it is necessary to define the background in which the pilot actions shall be inserted (the situation in the analysed MS) and to perform an on-purpose segmentation, by analysing and elaborating existing statistics databases to which apply similar indicators, compatible with the available information.
