Text 1, Satz 5
In our paper, we hypothesize that a important source of the heterogeneous effects observed in the Opower peer comparison might be consumers' environmental values.

Text 1, Satz 6
While the conservation behaviour of people with high biospheric values has been well- documented in the iterature, little is known about these consumers' responses to peer comparison.

Text 1, Satz 7
In this paper, we test whether there is an effect of social comparison on energy conservation and whether this effect depends on the extent to which individuals endorse high environmental values.

Text 1, Satz 8
Another important gap in research is this understanding of the mechanisms behind individuals' reactios to Opower's HER with regard to their energy use.

Text 1, Satz 9
The HER contains different elements, including a static neighbour comparison of energy consumption levels (a discriptive norm), feedback on individual performance (an injunctive norm), as well as energy saving tips.

A further objective of this paper is to asse

Text 4, Satz 5
Such advisory are specifically trained to implement the pilot actions by educating energy vulnerable consumers (VCS) to optimize (and, possibly, reduce) their energy consumption, motly through behavioural changes.

Text 4, Satz 6
In the project, Energy Consumption Research Institute is responsibleof the technical training of the HEAs and the pilot actions planning.

Text 4, Satz 7
This paper collects the first results of te above mentioned tasks.

Text 4, Satz 8
The first part of the paper summarizes the results of a statistical analysis performed to understand how to define an "energy poor" or "energy vulnerable" consumer, as a common European definition does not exist.

Text 4, Satz 9
The main obstacle in performing this analysis is that the data often used for standard indicators (e.g. Low-Income High-Costs) are not available in many countries, so new ways have to be explored.

Text 4, Satz 10
Moreover, the availability of different data in the EU countries leads to a fragm
