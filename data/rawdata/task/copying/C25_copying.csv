;In our Paper we speculate that environmental values represent an important sources of heterogenity in the effect of the Opower peer comparison.;It does so by implementing a series of pilot actions with a group of advisors called HEAs (Home Energy Advisors).;
;While the conversation behavior of people with high biospheric values has been largely studied in the literature, little is known about the response of the individuals to peer comparison.;These advisors have been specifically trained to implement the pilot actions by educating vulnerable consumers to optimize, and possibly reduce, their energy consumption, mostly through behavioral changes-;
;in this paper we test the effect of sociaö comparison on energy conversation and wheter this depends on the extent to whcih individuals endorse high environmental values.;;
;Another important gap in research is the understanding of the mechanisms behind individuals' reaction to the Opower Home Energy Report (HER) in the field of energy use.;This paper presents the initial results of these two tasks,;
;The HER delivers different elements, from a static neighbour comparison on energy consumption (descriptive norm), to feedback;"The first part of the paper summarizes the results of a statistical analysis performed in order to definde ""energy-poor"" or ""energy-vulnerbale"" consumers, as a common European definition does not exist.";
;;The main obstacle in performing this analysis is that the data often used for standard indicators (e.g. Low ;
