;The influence of social information on behaviour has been demonstrated in a variety of settings.;;
;Research shows that telling people how their actions compare with those of similar others leads them to modify their energy and water consumption, their contributions to charitable causees, and their saving decisions.;;
;Despite growing interest in social comparison research, several open questions remain.;;
;In particular, relatively little is known about the sources of heterogeneity in the effect of a well-known experiment of social comparison, such as the one provided by the Opower program through the Home Electricity Report.;;
;In our paper we speculate that environmental values represent an important source of heterogeneity in the effect of the Opower peer comparison.;It does so by implementing a series of pilot actions with a group of advisors called HEAs (Home Energy Advisors).;
;While the conservation behaviour of peole with high biospheric values has been largely studied in the literature, little is known about the response of these individuals to peer comparison.;These advisors have been specifically trained to implement the pilot actions by educating vulnerable consumers to optimize, and possibly reduce, their energy consumption, mostly through behavioural changes.;
;In this paper we test the effect of social comparison on energy conservation and whether this depends on the extent to which individuals endorse high environmental values.;In this project, the Energy Consumption Research Institute is responsible for the technical training of HEAs and for planning the pilot actions.;
;"Another important gap in research is the understanding of the mechanisms behind individuals'"" reaction to the Opower Home Energy Report (HER) in the field of energy use.";This paper presents the initial results of these two tasks.;
;The HER delivers different elements, from a static neighbour comparison on energy consumption (descriptive norm), to feedbacks on how well an individual is performing (injunctive norm), as well as energy saving tips.;"The first part of the paper summarizes the results of a statistical analaysis performed in order to define ""energy-poor"" or ""energy-vulnerable"" consumers, as a common European definition does not exist.";
;A second objective of his paper is to test possible mechanisms that make the HER effective.;The main obstacle in performing this analysis is that the data often used for standard indicators (e.g. Low Income High Costs) are not available in many countries, so new ways to define energy-vulnerable consumers have to be explored.;
;"First, we test if the HER shapes individuals'"" perceptions of the norm in the domain of energy conservation.";Moreover, the differences in the data available in Eu countries lead to fragmented and often incompatible consumer segmentation in the member states.;
;A stronger perception of the norm in the direction of energy conservation my t;To overcome this barrier, it is necessary to define the background against which the pilot actions are to be implemented (the situation in the MS analysed) and to perform a targeted market segmentation by analyzing and enhancing existing databases to which similar and compatible incators are applicable.;
;;The second part of the paper briefly introduces the training offered to the HEAs, in order to show which competences an HEA needs before approacting a vulnerable consumer or family, and how to build these competences.;
;;The third part represents the core of the paper, which focuses on planning the pilots actions.;
