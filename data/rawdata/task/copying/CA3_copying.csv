The influence of social information on behaviour has ben demonstrated in a variety of settings.;;;
For example, research indicates that telling people how their actions compare with those of other, similar people encourages them to modifiy their energy and water consumption, their contributions to charitable causes, and their savings decisions.;;;
Despite a growing interest in social comparison research, though, several questions remain open.;;;
In particular, relatively little is known about the sources of the heterogeneity observed in the effects of classical social comparison experiments, such as Opower's Home Electricity Report (HER) program.;;;With this in mind, the project (funded by EU Commission under Grant Agreement n. 12345), of which Energy Consumption Research Institute is a partner, aims to find some best practices and recommendations to address Energy Poverty from the implementation of a series of pilot actions with a group of advisors (called HEAs - Home Energy Advisors).
In our paper, we hypothesize that an important source of the heterogeneous effects observed in the Opower peer comparison might be consumer' environmental values.;;;Such advisors are specifically trained to implement the pilot actions by educating energy vulnerable consumers (VCs) to optimize (and, possibly, reduce) their energy consumption, mostly through behavioural changes.
While the conservation behaviour of people with high biospheric values has been well-documented in the literature, little is known about these consumer' responses to peer comparison.;;;In the project, Energy Consumption Research Institute is responsible of the technical training pf HEAs and the pilot actions planning.
In this paper, we test whether there is an effect of social comparison on energy conservation and whether this effect depens on the exten;;;This paper collects the first results of the above mentioned tasks.
;;;"The first part of the paper summarizes the results of a statistical analysis performed to understand how to define an ""energy poor"" or ""energy vulnerable"" consumer, as a common European definition does not exist."
;;;The main obstacle in performing this analysis is that the data often used for standard indicators (e.g. Low-Income High-Costs) are not available in many countri
