;In our paper we speulate that environmental values represent an important source of heterogeneity in the effect of the Opower peer comparison;It does so by implementing a series of pilot actions with a group of advisors called HEAs (Home Energy Advisors).;
;While the conservation behaviour of people with high biospheric values has been largely studied in the literature, little is known about the response of these individuals to peer comparison.;These advisos have been specifically trained to implement the pilot actions by educating vulnerable consumers to optimize, and possibly reduce, their energy consumption, mostly through behavioural changes.;
;In this paper we test the effect of social comparison on energy conservation and whether this depends on the extentto which individuals endorse high environmental values.;In this project, the Energy Consumption Research Institute is responsible for the technical training of HEAs and for planning the pilot actions.;
;Another important gap in research is the understanding of the mechanisms behind individuals' reaction to the Opower Home Energy Report (HER) in the field of energy use.;This paper presents the initial results of these two tasks.;
;The HER delivers different elements, from a static neighbour comparison on energy consumption (descriptive norm), to feedbacks on how well an individual is performing (injunctive norm), as well as energy saving tips.;"The first part of the paper summarizes the results of a statistical analysis performed in order to define ""energy-poor""or ""energy-vulnerable"" consumers, as a common European definition does not exist.";
;A second objective of this paper is to test possible mechanisms that make the HER effective.;The main obstacle in performing this analysis is that the data often used for standard indicators(e.g. Low Income High Costs) are not availble in many countries, so new ways to define energy-vulnerable consumers have to be explored.;
;First, we test if the HER shapes individual's perceptions of the norm in the domain of energy conservation.;Moreover, the differences in data available in EU countries lead to fragmented and often incompatible consumer segmentation in the member states.;
;A stronger perception of the norm in the direction of energy conservation may then influence energy consumption.;To overcome this barrier, it is necessary to define the background against which the pilot actions are to be implemented (the situation in the MS analysed) and to perform a targeted market segmentation by analyzing and enhancing existing databases to which similar and compatible indicators are applicable.;
;Second, while environmental values tend to be stable in everyone's life, environmental self-identity can be influenced, for example, through information regarding energy conservation.;The second part of the paper briefly introduces the training offered to the HEAs, in order to sho which competences an HEA needs befoe approaching a vulnerable consumer or family, and how to ;
;A second mechanism could therefore be that the information delivered in the HER increases one's environmental self-identity.;;
;By activating biospheric values, the HER strenghtens people's focus on benefiting the ;;
