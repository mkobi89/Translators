In particular, relatively litte is known about the sources of the heterogeneity observed in the effects iof classic social comparison experiments, such as Opower's Home Electricty Report (HER) program.;;;With this in mind, the project (founded by EU Commission under Grant Agreement n. 12345), of which Energy Consumption Research Institute is a partner, aims to find some best practices and reommendations to address Energy Poverty from the implementation of a series of pilot actions with a group of advisors (called HEAs - Home Energy Advisors).
"In our paper, we hypoherize that an important source of the heterogeneous effects observed in the Opower peer comparison might be consumes'"" environmental values.";;;Such advisors are specifically trained to implement the pilot actions by educating energy vulnerable consumers (VCs) to optimize (and, possibly, reduce) their energy consumption, mostly through behavioural changes.
While the conservation behaviour of people with high biospheric values has been well-doumented in the literature, little is known about these consumers' responses to peer comparison.;;;In the projct, Energy Consumption Research Institute is responsible of the technical training of HEAs and the pilot actions planning.
In this paper, we test whether there is an effect of social comparison of energy conservation and whether this effect depends on the extent of which individuals endorse high environmental values.;;;This paper collects the first results of the above mentioned tasks.
Another important gap in research is the understanding of the mechanisms behind individuals' reactionsto Opower's HER with regard to their energy use.;;;"The first part of the paper summarizes the results of a statistical analysis performed to understand how to define an ""energy poor"" or ""energy vulnerable"" consumer, as a common European definition does not exist."
The HER contains different elements, including a static neighbour comparison of energy consumption levels (a descritpive norm), feedback on individual performance (an injunctive norm), as well as enegy saving tips.;;;"The main obstacle in performing this analysis is that the data often used for standard indicators (e.g. Low-Income High-Costs) are not available in many coutries, so new ways to understand what is an ""energy vulnerable consumer"" have to be explored."
A fu;;;Moreover, the availability of different data in the EU countries leads to a fragemnted
