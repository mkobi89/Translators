;Despite growing interest in social comparison research, several open questions remain.;One of the points stressed by the EC is the importance of learning from experience and from the best practices being carried out in various member states (MS).;
;In particular, relatively little is known about the sources of heterogeneity in the effect of a well-known experiment of social comparison, such as the one provided by the Opower program through the Home Electricity Report.;With this in mind, the project reported here (funded by the EU Commission under Grant Agreement no. 12345), of which the Energy Consumption Research Institute is a partner, aims to uncover best practices and recommendations to address energy poverty.;
;In our paper we speculate that environmental values represent an important source of heterogeneity in the effect of ;It does so by implementing a series of pilot actions with a group of advisors called HEAs (Home Energy Advisors).;
;;These advisors have been specifically trained to implement the pilot actions by educating vulnerable consumers to optimize, and possibly reduce, their energy consumption;
