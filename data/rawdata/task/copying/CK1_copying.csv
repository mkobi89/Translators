The influence of social information on behaviour has been demonstrated ina variety ofsetting.;;;
For Example, research indicates that telling people how their actions comparewith those of other, similar people encourages them to modify their energy and water consumption, their contributins to charitable causes, and their savings decisions.;;;
Despite a growing interest in social comparison research, though, several question remain open.;;;
In particular, relatively lttl is known about the sources of the heterogeneity observed in the effectsof classic social comparison experiments, such as Opower's Home Electricity Report (HER) program.;;;
In our paper, we hypothesize that an important source of the heterogeneous effects observed in the Opower peer comparison might be consumers' environmental values;;;Such advisors are specifically trained to implement the pilot actions by educating energy vulerable consumers (VCs) to optimize (and, possibly, reduce) their energy consumption, mostly throught behavioural changes.
While the conservation behaviour of people with hight biospheric values has been wess- documented in the literature, little is known about these consumers' responses to peer comparison.;;;In the project, Energy Consumption Research Institute is responsible of the technical training of HEAs and te pilot actions planning.
In this paper, we test whether there is an effect of social comparison on energy conservation and whether this effect depends on the extent to which individuals endorse hight evnironmental values;;;This paper collects the first results of the above mentioned tasks.
"Another important gap in research is th understanding of the mechanisms behind individuals' reactions to Opower'""s HEr with regard to their engery use.";;;"The first paprt of the paper summarizes the results of a statistical analysis performed to understand how to define an ""energy poor"" or ""energy vulerable"" consumer, as a common European definition does not exist."
The HER contains different elements, includ;;;"The main obstacle in performing this analysis is that the data often used for standard indicators (e.g. Low-Income High-Costs) are not available in many countries, wo new ways to understand what is an Energy vulerable consumer"" have to be explored."
;;;"Moreover, the availability of different data in the Eu contries leads to a fragmanted and often ""not compatible"" segmentation in different Member States."
;;;To overcome this barrier, it is necessary to define the background in which the pilot actions shall be inserted (the situation in the analysed MS) and to perform an on-purpose segmentation, by analysing and elaborating existing statistics databases tho wich apply similar indicators, compatible wth the available information.
;;;The second part of the paper briefly introduces the training that wllbe proposed to the HEAs, in order to show which competences are required to anHE
