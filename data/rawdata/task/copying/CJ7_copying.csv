The influence of social information on behaviour has been demonstrated in a variety of settings.;;;Energy Poverty is one of the main social, technical and legislative issues of he present time in Europe, with an estimated number of affected people ranging from 50 to 125 million.
For example, research indicates that telling people how their actions compare with those of other, similar people encourages them to modify their energy and water consumption, their contribution to charitable causes, and their savings decisions.;;;The European Commission (EC) has put a lot of effort to solve this issue, as shown, for example, by the recent launch of the EU Energy Poverty Observatory in January 2018.
Despite a growing interest in a social comparision research, though, several questions remain open.;;;One the points stressed by the EC is the importance to learn from the experiences and best practices carried out in the different Members states (MS).
"In particular, relatively little is known about the sourcesof the heterogeneity observed in the effects of classic social comparison experiments, such as Opower'""s Home Electricity Report (HER) program.";;;With this in mind, the project (funded by EU Commission under Grant Agreement n. 12345), of which Energy Consumption Research Institute is a partner, aims to find some best practies and recommendations to address Energy Poverty from the implementation of a series of pilot actions with a group of advisors (called HEAs - Home Energy Advisors).
In our paper, we hypothesize that an important source of the heterogeneous effects observed in the Opower peer comparison might be conumers' environmental values.;;;Such advisors are specifically trained to implement the pilot actions by educating energy vulnerable consumers (VCs) to optimize (and, possibly, reduce) their energy consumption, mostly through behavioural changes.
While the conversatn behaviour of people with high biospheric values has been well- documented in the literature, little is known about these consumers' responses to peer comparison.;;;In the project, Energy Consumption Research Institute is responsible of the technical training
In this paper, we test whether there is an effect of social comparison on energy conversation and whether this effect depends on th extent to whic indi;;;
