;The influence of social information on behaviour has been demonstrated in a variety of settings.;Energy poverty is one ofthe main social, technical and legislative issus at the present time in Europe, wih teh estimated number of people who are affected ranging from 50 to 125 million.;
;Research shows that telling people how their actions compare with those of similar others leads them to modify their energy and water consumption, their contributions to charitable causes, and their saving decisions.;The European Commission (EC) has put a great deal of effort into solving this issue, as shown, for example, by the recent launch of the EU Energy Poverty Observatoy in January 2018.;
;Despite growing interest in social comparison research, several open questions remain.;One of the ponts stressed by the ECi the importance of learning from experience andfrom th best practices being carried out in various member States (MS).;
;In particular, relatively little is known about the sources of heterogenity in the effect of a well-known experiment of social comparison, such as the one provided by the Opower program through the Home Electricity Report.;With this in mind, the project reported here (funded by the EU Commission under Grant Agreement no. 12345), of which the Energy Consumption Research Institute is partner, aims to uncover best practices and recommendations to address energy poverty.;
;In our paper we speculate that environmental values represent an important source of heterogeneity in the effect of the Opower peer comparison.;It does so by implementing a series of pilot actions with a group of advisors called HEAs (Home Energy Advisors).;
;While the conservation behaviour of people with high biospheric values has been largely studied in the literature, little is known about the response of these individuals to peer comparison.;These advisors have been specifically trained to implement the pilot actions by educationg vulnerable consumer to optimize, and possibly reduce, their energy consumption, mostly through behavioural changes.;
;In this paper e test the effect of social comparison on energy conservation and whether this depends on the extent to which indiviuals endorse high environmental values.;In this project, The Energy Consumption Research Institute is responsible for the technical training of HEAs and for planning the pilot actions.;
;Another important gap in research is the understanding of the mechanisms behind individuals' reaction to the Opower Home Energy Report (HER) in the field of energy use.;This paper presents the initial results of these two tasks.;
;The HER delivers different elements, from a static neighbour comparison on energy consumption (descriptive norm), to feedbacks on how well an individual s performing (injunctive norm), as well as energy saving tips.;"The first paper of the paper summarizes the result of a statistical analysis performed in order to define ""energy-poor"" or ""energy-vuln";
;A second objective of this paper is to test possible mechanisms that make the HER effective.;;
;First, we test if the HER shapes individuals' perceptions of the norm in t;;
