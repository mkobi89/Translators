;;;Such advisorsare specifically trained to implement the pilot actions by educating enrgy vulnerable cnsumers( Vcs) to optimize (and , possibly, reduce) their energ consumtion, mostly through behavioural changes.
While the conservation behavior of people with high biospheric values has been well- documented in the literature, little is known about these consumers' responses to peer comparison.;;;in the project, Energy Consumption Research Institute is responsible of the technica training of HEas and the pilot actions planning.
In this paper, we test whether there is an effect of social comparison on energy conservation and whether this effect depends on the extent to which individuals endorse high environmental values.;;;this paper collects the first results of the above mentioned tasks.
Another important gap in research is the understanding of the mechanisms behind individuals' reactions to Opower's HER with regard to their energy use.;;;"the first part of the paper summarizes the results of a statistical analysis performed to understand how to define an ""energy poor"" or ""energy vulnerable"" consumer, as a common European definition does not exist."
The HER contains different elements, including a static neighbour comparison of energy consumption levels (a descriptive norm), feedback on individual performance (an injunctive norm), as well as energy saving tips.;;;The main obstacle in performing this analysis is that the data often used for standard indicators (e.g. Low-Income High-Costs) are not available in many countries, so new ways to understand wat is an 
A further objective of this paper is to assess possible mechanisms to make the HER more effective.;;;
First, we test whether the HER shapes individuals' perceptions of norms in the domain of energy conservation.;;;
A stronger perception of the norm to conserve energy may then influence energy consumption.;;;
While environmental values tend to be stable throughout people's lives, environmental self-identity can be influenced, for example by information regarding energy conservation.;;;
A second mechanism could therefore be that the information delivered wi;;;
