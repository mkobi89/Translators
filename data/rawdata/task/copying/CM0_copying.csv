;;;Energ Poverty is one of the main social, technical and legislative issues of the present time in Europe, with an estimated number of affected people ranging from 50 to 125 million. 
;;;The European Comission (EC) has put a lot of effort to solve this issue, as shown, for example, by the recent launch of the EU Energy Poverty Observatory in January 2018. 
;;;One the points stressed by the EC is the importance to learn from the experiences and best practices carried out in the different Members states (MS). 
;;;With this in mind, the project (funded by EU Comission under Grant Agreement n. 12345), of which Energy Consumption Research Institute is a partner, aims to find some best practices and recommendations to address Energy Poverty from the implementation of a series of pilot actions with a group of advisors (called HEAs - Home Energy Advisors). 
;;;Such advisors are specifically trained to implement the pilot actions by educating energy vulnerable consumers (VCs) to optimize (and, possibly, reduce) their energy consumption, mostly through behavioural changes. 
While the conservation behavior of people with high biospheric values has been well-documented in the literature, little is known about these consumers' responses to peer comparison. ;;;In the project, Energy Cosn
In this paper, we test whether there is an effect of social comparison on energy conservation and whether this effect depends on the extent to which individuals endorse high environmental values;;;
"Another important gap in research is the understanding of the mechanisms behind individuals'"" reactions to Opower's HER with regard to their energy use. ";;;
The HER contains different eements, including a static neighbour comparison of energy consumption levels (a descriptive nrom), feedback on individual performance (an injunctive norm), as well as enery saving tips. ;;;
A further objective of this paper is to assess possible mechanisms to make the HER more effective. ;;;
First, we test whether the HER shapes individuals' perceptions of norms in the domain of energy conservation. ;;;
A stronger perception of the norm to conserve energy may then influence energy consumption. ;;;
While environmental values tend to be stable throughout people's lives, environmental self-identity can be influenced, for example by information regarding energy conservation. ;;;
A second mechanism could therefore be that the information delivered with the HER enhances consumer's environmental self-identity. ;;;
By activating biospheric values, the HER strengthens consumers' focus on benefiting the environment. ;;;
