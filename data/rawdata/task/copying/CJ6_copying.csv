;In our paper we speculate that environmentl values represent an important source of heterogeneity in the effect of the Opower peer comparison.;It does so by implementing a series of pilot actions with a group of advisors calles HEAs (Home Energy Advisors).;
;While the conservation behaviour of people with high biospheric values has been largely studied in th literature, little is known about the response of these individuals to peer comparison.;These advisors have been specifically trained to implement the pilot actions by educating vulnerable consumers to optimize, and possibly reduce, their energyconsumption, mostly through behavioural changes.;
;In this paper we test the effect of social comparison on energy conservation and whether this depends on the extent to which individuals endorse high environmental values,;In this project, the Energy Consumption Research Institute is responsible for the technical training of HEAs and for planning the pilot actions.;
;Another important gap in research is the understanding of the mechanisms behind individuals' reaction to the Opower Home Energy Report (HER) in the field of energy use.;This paper presents the initial results of these two tasks.;
;The HER dlivers fifferent elements, from a static neighbor comparison on enerygy consumption (descriptive norm), to feedbacks on how well an individual is peforming (injunctive norm), as well as energy saving ;"The first part ofthe paper summarizes the results of a statistical analysis performed in order to define ""energy-poor"" or ""energy-vulnerable"" consumers, as a common European definition does not exist.";
;;The main obstacle in perfoming this analysis is that data often used for standard indicato;
