For example, research indicates that telling people how their actions compare with those of other, similar people encourages them to modify their energy and water consumption, their contributions to charitable causes, and their savings decisions.;;;The European Commission (EC) has put a lot of effort to solve this issue, as shown, for example, by the recent launch of the EU Energy Poverty Observatory in January 2018.
Despite a growing interest in social comparison research, though, several questions remain open.;;;One the points stressed by the EC is the importance to learn from the experiences and best practices carried out in the different Members States (MS).
In particular, relatively little is known about the sources of the heterogemeity observed in the effects of classic social comparison experiments, such as Opower's Home Electricity Report (HER) program.;;;With this in mind, the project (funded by EU Commission under Grant Agreement n. 12345), of which Energy Consumption Research Institute is a partner, aims to find some best practices and recommendations to address Energy Poverty from the implementation
In our paper, we hypothesize that an important source of the heterogeneous effects observed in the Opower p;;;
