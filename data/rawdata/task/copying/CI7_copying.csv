The influence of social information on behaviour has been demonstrated in a variety of settings.;;;
For example, research indicates that telling people how their actions compare with those of other, similar people encourages them to modify their energy and water consumption, their contributions to charitable causes, and their savings decisions.;;;
Despite a growing interest in social comparison research, though, several questions remain open.;;;
In particular, relatively little is known about the sources of the heterogenity observed in the effects of classic social comparison experiments, such as Opower's Home Electricity Report (HER) program.;;;
In our paper, we hypothesize that an important source of the hetereogeneous effects ober;;;Such advisors are specifically trained to implement the pilot actions by educating energy vulnerable consumers (VC) to optimize (and, possibly, reduce) their energy consumption, mostly through behavioural changes.
;;;In the project, Energy Consumption Research Institute is respinsible of the technical training of HEAs and the pilot actions planning.
;;;This paper collects the first results of the above mentioned tasks.
