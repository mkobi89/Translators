;;Energy poverty is one of the main social, technical and legislative issues at the present time in Europe, with the estimated number of people who are affected ranging from 50 to 125 million.;
;;The European Commission (EC) has put a great deal of effort into solving this issue, as shown, for example, by the recent launch of the EU Energy Poverty Observatory injanuary 2018.;
;;One of the points adressed by the EC is the importance of learning from experience and from the best practises being carried out ni various member states (MS).;
;;With this in mind, the project reported here (funded by the EU Commisson under Grant Agreement no. 12345). of which the Energy Consumption Research Insititute is a partner, aims to uncover best practises and recommendations to adress energy poverty.;
;;It does so by implementing a series of pilot actions with agrooup of advisrors called HEAs (home Enery Advisros).;
;;These advisors have been specificlly trained to implement the pilot actions by educating vnearble consumers to optimise, and possibly reduce, their energy consumption, mostly through behavioural changes.;
;In this paper we test the effect of social comparison on energy conservation and whether this depnds on th eextnt to which individuals ndorse high environmental values.;In this project, the Energy Consumption Research Institute is responsible for the technical training of HEA;
;Another important gap in research is the understanding of the mechanism behind indivdualsreaction to theh Opower Home Energy Report (HER) in the fielf of enegy use.;;
;The HER delivrs different elements, from a static neighbour comparison on energy consumption (descriptive norm), to feedbacks on hiw well an individual is performing (nijungtive norm), as wlel as energy saving tips.;;
;A second objective of this paper is to test possible mechanisms that mae the HER effective.;;
;First, we test of the HEr shapes individuals perceptions of the norm in the domain of energy conservation.;;
;A stronger perception of the norm in the direction of energy conservation may then influence energy consumption.;;
;Second, while environmental values tend to be stable in eeryones life, environmental self-identity can be influenced, for example, through informtion regarding energy conservation.;;
;A second mechanism could therefore be that the information delivered in the HER increases ones environmental elf-identity.;;
;"By activting biospheric values, the HER strenghthens people'""s focus on benefiting the enivironmet";;
;The analysis combines data from a large randomised pogram conducted by Opower initaly, with surey data collected among utility customers.;;
;The data vailble from the utility details wheter a person receives the social information throught the HER, the frequenc;;
