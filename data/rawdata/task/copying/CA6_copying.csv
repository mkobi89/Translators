The influence of social information on behaviour has been demonstrated in a variety of settings ;;;
For example, research indicates that telling people how their actions compare with those of other, similar people encourages them to modify their energy and water consumption, their contributions to charitable causes, and their savings decisions.;;;
Despite a growing interest in social comparison research, though, several questions remain open.;;;
In particular, relatively little is known about the sources of heterogeneity observed in the effexts of classic social comparison experiments, such as Opower's Home Electricity Report (HER) program. ;;;
In our paper, we hypothesize that an important source of the heterogeneous effects observed in the Opower peer comparison might be consumer's environmental values. ;;;Such advisors are specifically trained to implement the pilot actions by educating energy vulnerable consumers (VCs) to optimize (and, possibly, reduce) their energy consumption, mostly through behavioural changes. 
While the conservation behaviour of people with high biosphreric values has been well- documented in the literature, little is known about t;;;In the project, Energy Consumption Research Institute is responsible of the technical training of HEAs and the pilot actions planning. 
;;;This paper collects the first results of the above mentioned tasks. 
;;;"The first part of the paper summarizes the results of a statistical analysis performed to understand how to define an ""energy poor"" or ""energy vulnerable"" consumer, as a common European definition does not exist. "
;;;"The main obstacle in performing this analysis is that the data often used for standard indicators (e.g. Low-Income High-Costs) are not available in many coutries, so new ways to understand what is an ""energy vulnerable consumer"" have to be explored. "
;;;"Moreover, the availibility of different data in the EU coutries leads to a fragmented and often ""not compatible"" segmentation in different Member States. "
;;;To overcome this barrier, it is necessary to define the background in which the pilot ac
