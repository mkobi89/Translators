Despite a growing interest in social comparison research, though, several questions remain open.;;;
In particular, relatively little is known about the sources of the heterogeneity observed in the effects of classic social comparison experiments, such as Opower's Home Electricity Report (HER) program.;;;With this in mind, the project (funded by EU Commission under Grant Agreeent n. 12345), of which Energy Consumption Research Institute is a partner, aims to find some best practices and recommendations to address Energy Poverty from the implemenation of a series of pilot actions with a group of advisors (called HEAs  - Home Energy Advisors).
In our paper, we hypothesize that an important source of the heterogeneous effects observed in the Opower peer comparison might be consumers' envitonmental values.;;;Such advisors are specifically trained to implement the pilot actions by educating energy vulnerable consumers (VCs) to optimize (and, possibily, reduce) their energy consumption, mostly through behavioural changes. 
While the vonservation behaviour of people with high biospheric values has been well- documented in the literature, little is known about these consumers' responses to peer comparison.;;;In the project, Energy Consumption Research Institute is responsible of the technical training of HEAs and the pilot actions planning.
In this paper, we test whether there is an effect of social comparison on energy conservation and whether this effect depends on the extent to which individuals endorse high environmental values.;;;This paper collects the first results of the above mentioned tasks.
Another important gap in research is the understanding of the mechanism behind individuals' reactions to Opower's HER with regard to their energy use.;;;"The first part of the paper summarizes the results of a statistical analysis performed to understand how to define an ""energy poor"" or ""energy vulnerable"" consumer, as a common European definition does not exist."
