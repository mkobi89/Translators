Despite a growing interest in social comparison research, though, several questions remain open.;;;One the points stressed by the Ec ist the importance to learn from the experiences and the best practices carried out in the different Members states (MS).
"In particular, relatively little is known about the sources of the heterogeneity observed in the effects of classic social comparison experiments, such as Opower'""s Home Electricity Report (HER) program.";;;With this in mind, the project (funded by Eu Commission under Grant Agreement n. 12345). of which Energy Consumption Research Institute is a partner, aims to find some best practices and recommendations to address Energy Poverty from the imlementation of a series of pilot actions with a group of advisors (calles HEAs - Home Energy Advisors).

"While the conservation behaviour of people with high biospheric values has been well-documented in the literatue, little is known about these consumers'"" resp";;;
