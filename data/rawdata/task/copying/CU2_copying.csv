;;With this in mind, the project reported here (funded by the EU Commission under Grant Agreement no. 12345), of which the Energy Consumption Research Institute is a partner, aims to uncover best practices and recommendations to address energy poverty.;
;;It does so by implementing a series of pilot actions with a group of advisors called HEAs (Home Energy Advisors).;
;;These advisors have been specifically trained to implement the pilot actions by educating vulnerable consumers to optimize, and possible rduce, their energy consmption, mostly through behavioural changes.;
;In this paper we test the effect of social comparison on energy conservation and whether this depends on th extent to which individuals endorse high environmetal values.;In this project, the Energy Consumption Research Institute is responsible for the technical training of HEAs and for planning the pilot actions.;
;Another important gap in research is the understandingof the mechanisms behind individuals' reaction to the Opower Home Energy Report (HER) in the field f energy use.;This paper presents the initial results of these two tasks.;
;The HER delivers different elements, from a static neighbou comparison on energy consumption (descriptive norm), to feedbacks on how well an individual is performing (injunctive norm), as well as energy saving tips.;"The first part of the paper summarizes the results of a statistical analysis performed in order to define ""energy-poor"" or ""energy-vulnerable"" consumers, as a common European definition does not exist.";
;A second objective of this paper is to test possible mechanisms that make the HER effective.;The main obstacle in performing this analysis is that the data often used for standard indicators (e.g. Low Income High Costs) re not available in many countries, so new ways to define energy-vulnerable consumers have to be explored.;
;First, we test if the HER shapes individuals' perceptions of the norm n the domain of energy conservation.;Moreover, the differences in the data available in EU countries lead to fragmented and often incompatible consumer segmentation in the member states.;
;A stronger perception of the norm in the direction of energy conservation may then influence energy consumption.;To overcome this barrier, it is necessary to define the background against which the pilot actions are to;
;Second, while environmental values tend to be stable in everyone's life, environmental self-identity can be influenced, for example, through information regarding energy conservation.;;
;A second mechanism could therefore be that the information delivered in the HER increases one's environmetal self-identity.;;
;By activating biospheric values, the HER strengthens peopleps focus on benefiting the environment.;;
;The analysis combines data from a large randomized program conducted by Opower in Italy, with survey data collected among utility customers.;;
;The data vailable from the ulitity details whether a person receives the social information through the Home Energy Report, the freuency and type of social info;;
