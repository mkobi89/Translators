;;;Energy Poverty is one of the main social, technical and legislatve issues of the present time in Europe, withan estimated number of affected people ranging from 50 to 125 million.
;;;The European Commission (EC) has put a lot of effort to solve this issue, as shown, for example, by the recent launch of the EU Energy Poverty Observatory in Januray 2018.
Despite a grwoing interest in social comparison research, though, several questions remain open.;;;One the points stressed by the EC is the importance to learn from the experiences and best practices carried out in the different Members states (MS).
In particular, relatively little is known about the sources of the heterogeneity observed in the effects of classic social comparison experiments, such as Opower's Home Electricity Report (HER) program.;;;With this in mind, the project (funded by the EU Commission under Grant Agreement n. 12345), of which Energy Consumption Research Institute is a partner, aims to find some best practices and recommendations to address Energy Poverty from the implementation of a series of pilot actions with a group of advisors (called HEAS - Home EnEbnEn
In our paper, we hypothesize that an important source of the heterogeneous effects observed in the Opower peer comparison might be consumer's environmental values.;;;Such advisors are specifically
While the conservation behaviour of people with high biospheric values has been well- documented in the literature, little is known about these consmer's responses to peer comparison.;;;
In this paper, we test whether there is an effect of social comparison on energy conservation and whether this effect depends on the extent to which individuals endorse high environmental values.;;;
Another important gap in research is the und;;;
