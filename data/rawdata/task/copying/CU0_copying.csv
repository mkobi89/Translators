;In our paper we speculate that environmental values represent an important source of heterogeneity in the effect of the Opower peer comparison.;It does so by implementing a series of pilot actions with a group of advisors calles HEAs (Home Energy Advisors).;
;While the conservation behaviour of people with high biospheric values has been largely studied in the literature, little is known about the response of these individuals to peer comparison.;These advisors have been specifically trained to implement the pilot actions by educating vulnerable consumers to optimize, and possibly reduce, their energy consumption, mostly through behavioural changes.;
;In this paper we test the effect of social comparison on energy conservation and whether this depends on the extent to which individuals endorse high environmental values.;In this project, the Energy Consumption Research Institute is responsible for the teaching training of HEAs and for planning the pilot actions.;
;Another important gap in research is the understanding of the mechanisms behind individuals' reaction to the Opower Home Energy Report (HER) in the field of energy use.;This paper presents the initial results of these two tasks.;
;The HER delives differnt elements, from a static neighbour comparison on energy consumption (descriptive norm), to feedbacks on how well an individual is performing (injunctive norm), as well as energy saving tips.;"The first part of the paper summarizes the results of a statistical analysis performed in order to define ""energy-poor"" or ""energy-vulnerable"" consumers, as a common European definition does not exist.";
;A second objective of this paper is to test possible mechanisms that make the HER effective.;The main obstacle in performing this analysis is that the data often used for standard indicators (e.g. Low Income High Costs) are not available in many countries, so new ways to define energy-vulnerable consumers have to be explored.;
;First, we test if the HER shapes individuals';Moreover, the differences in the data available in EU countries lead to fragmented and often incompatible consumer segmentation in the member states.;
; A stronger perception of te norm in the direction of energy conservation may then influence energy consumption.;;
;Second, while environmental valu;;
