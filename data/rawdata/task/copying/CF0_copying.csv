;;"The frst part of the paper summarizes the results of a statistical analysis performed in order to define ""energy-poor"" or ""energy-vulnerable"" consumers, as a common European definition does not exist.";
;;The main obstacle in performing this analysis is that the data often used for standard indicators (e.g. Low Income High Costs) are not available in many countries, so new ways to define energy-vulnerable consumers have to be explored.;
;;Moreover, the differences in the data available in EU countries lead to fragmented and often incompatible consumer segmntation in the member states.;
;;To overcome this barrier, it is necessary to define the background against which the pi;
