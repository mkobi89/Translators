In particular, relatively little is known about the sources of the heterogeneity observed in the effects of classic social comparison experiments, such as Opower's Home Electricity Repport (HER) program.;;;With this in mind, the project (funded by EU Commission under Grant Agreement n. 12345), of which Energy Consumption Research Institure is a partner, aims to find some best practices and recommendation sto assress Energy Poverty from implementation of a series of pilot action with a group of advisors (called HEAs - Home Energy Advisior)-
In our paper, we hypothesize that an important source of the heterogeneous effects observed in the Opower peer comparison might be consumers' environmental values.;;;Such advisorsre specifically trained to implement the pilo actions by educating energy vulnerable consumers (VCs) to optimize (and, possibly, reduce) their energy consumption. most
While the conservation behaviour of people with high biospheric values has been well- documented in the literature. little is known about these consumers' responses to peer comparison.;;;
In this paper.we test whether there is an effect of social  comparison on energy conservati;;;
