The influence of social information on behaviour has been demonstrated in a variety of settings.;;;Energy Poverty is one of the main social, technical and legislative issues of the present time in Europe, with an estimated number of affected people ranging from 50 to 125 million.
For example, research indicates that telling people how their actions compare with those of other, similar people encourages them to modify their energy and water consumtion, their contributions to charitable cuases, and their savings decisions.;;;The European Commission (EC) has put a lot of effort to solve this issue, as shown, for example, by the recent launch auf the EU Energy Poverty Observatory in January 2018.
Despite a growing interest in social comparison research, though, several questions remain open.;;;On the points stressed by the EC is the importance to learn from the experiences and best practices carried out in the different Members states (MS).
In particular, relatively little is known about the sources of the heterogeneity observed in the effects of classic social comparison experiments, such as Opower's Home Electricity Report (HER) program.;;;With this in mind, the project (funded by EU Comission under Grant Agreement n. 12345), of which Energy Consumption Research Institute is a partner, aims to find some best practices and recommendations to address Energy Poverty from the implementation of a series of pilot actions with a group of advisors (called HEAs - Home Energy Advisors).
In our paper, we hypothesize that an important source of the heterogeneous effects observed in the Opower peer comparison might be consumers' environmental values.;;;Such advisors are specifically trained to implement the pilot actions by educating energy vulnerable consumers (VCs) to optimize (and, possibly, reduce) their energy consumption, mostly through behavioural changes.
While the conservation behaviour of people with high biospheric values has been well- documented in the literature, little is known about these consumers' responses to peer comparison.;;;In the project, Energy Consumption Research Institute is responsibel of the technical training of HEAs and the pilot actions planning.
In this paper, we test whether there is an effect of social comparison on energy conservation and whether this effect depends on the extent to which individuals endorse high environmental values.;;;This paper collects the first results of the above mentioned tasks.
Another important gap in research is the understanding of the mechanisms behind individuals' reactions to Opower's HER with regard to their energy use.;;;"The first part of the paper summarizes the results of a statistical analysis performed to understand how to define an ""energy poor"" or ""energy vulnerable"" consumer, as a common European definition does not exist."
The HER contains different elements, including a static neighbour comparison of energy consumption levels (a descriptive norm), feedback on individual performance (an injuncitve norm), as well as energy saving tips.;;;"The main obstacle in performin this analysis is that the data often used for standard indicators (e.g. Low-Income High-Costs) are not available in many countries, so new ways to understand what is an ""energy vulnerable consumer"" have to be explored."
A further objective of this paper is to assess possible mechanisms to make the HER more effective.;;;
First, we test whether the HER shapes individuals' perceptions of norms in the domain of energy conservation.;;;
A stronger perception of;;;
