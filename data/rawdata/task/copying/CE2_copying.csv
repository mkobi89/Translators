;The influence of social information on behaviour has been demonstrated in a variety of settings.;;
;Research shows that telling people how their actions compare with those of similar others leads them to modify their energy and water consumption, their contributions to charitable causes, and their saving decisions.;;
;Despite growing interest in social comparson research, several open questions remain.;;
;In particular, relatively little is known about the sources of heterogeneity in the effect of a well-known experiment of social comparison, such as the one provided by the Opower programm through the Home Electricity Report.;With this in mind, the project reported here (funded by the EU Commission under Grant Agreement no. 12345), of which the Energy Consumption Research Institute is a partner, aims to uncover best practices and recommendations to address energy poverty.;
;In our paper we speculate that environmental values represent an important source of heterogeneity in the effect of the Opower peer comparison.;It does so by implementing a serie of pilot actions with a group of advisors called HEAs (Home Energy Advisors).;
;While the conservation behaviour of people with high biospheric values has been largely studied in the literature, little is known about the response of these individuals to peer comparison.;These advisors have been specifically trained to implement the pilot actions by educating vulnerable consumers to optimize, and possibly reduce, their energy consumption, mostly through behavioural changes.;
;In this paper we test the effect of social comparison on energy conservation and whether this depends on the extent to which individuals endorse high environmental values.;In this project, the Energy Consumption Research Institute is responsible for the technical training of HEAs and for planning pilot actions.;
;Another important gap in research is the understanding of the mechanisms behind individuals' reaction to the Opower Home Enerv;This paper presents the initial results of these two tasks.;
;;"The first part of the paper summarizes the results of a statistical analysis performed in order to define ""energy-poor"" or ""energy-vulnerable"" consumers, as a common European definition does  not exist.";
;;The main obstacle in performing this analysis is that the data often used for standard indicators (e.g. Low Income High Costs) are not available in many ;
