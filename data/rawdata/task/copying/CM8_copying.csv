;The influence of social information on behaviour has been demonstraredin variety of settings;;
;Research shows that telling poeple how their action s compare with those of similar others leads them to modify thier energy and water consumption, thier contributions to charitable cuases, ant their saving decisions.;;
;Despite growing interset in social comparion research, several open questions remain.;;
;In particular, relatively little is known about the sources of geterogeneity in the effect of a well-known experiment of social comparison, such as the one provided by the Opower program through the Home Electicity Report.;;
;In our paper we speculate that envirionmental values represent an important source of heterogeneity in the effect of the Opower peer comparison.;It does so by implementing a series of pilot action swith a gourp of advisors calles HEAs (HomeEnergy Advisors).;
;While the conservation behaviour of people with high biospheric values has been largely studied in the literaure, little is know about the response of these indiciudals ot peer comparison.;These advisors have been specifically trainerd to implement the pilot actions by educating vulnerable consumers to optimize, and possibly reduce, their energy consumption, mostly though behavioural changes.;
;In this paper we test the effect of social comparison on energy conservation and whether this depends on the extent to which individuals endorese high environmental values.;In this poject, the Energy Consumption Research Institute is responsible for the technical training of HEAs and for planning the pilot actions.;
;Another imporant gap in research is the understading of the mechanisms behind indiviudlas'  reach;This paper presents the initial results of these two tasksk.;
;;"The first part of the paper summerizes the resrults of a statical analysis performed in ofder to define ""energy-poor"" or ""energy-vulnerable"" consumers, as a common European definition does not exist.";
;;The main obstable is perfomring this analyses is that the data often used for standard indicators (e.g. Low Income High Costs) are not avaiable in many countries, so new ways to define energy-vulnerable consumers have to be explored.;
