;The influence of social information on behaiour has been demonstrated in a variety of settings.;Energy poverty is one of the main social, technical and legislative issues at the present time in Europe, with th estimated number of people who are afected ranging from 50 to 125 million.;
;Research shows that telling prople how their actions compare with those of similar others leads the to moify their energy and water consumption, their contributions to charitable causes, and their saving decisions.;The European Commision (EC) has put a great deal of effort into solving thisisue, as shown, for example, by the recet auch of the EU Energy Poverty Obseroy n January 2018.;
;Despite growing interest in social comparison research, several open questions remain.;One o the ponts stressed by the Eis theimporacoffarning from experince and fo e bestpractcs being carriedout in variousmemberstates (MS).;
;In particular, relatively little is known about the sources of heterogeneity in the effect of a well-known experiment of social comparison, such as the one provided by the Opower program through the Home Electricity Report.;With this in mind, the project reported here (funded by theEU Commission under Grant Agreement no. 12345), of which the Energy Consumption Research Institute is a partner,aims to uncover best practices and recommendations to address energy poverty.;
;Ino ur paper we speculate that environmental values represent an important source of heterogeneity in the effect of the Opower peer comparison.;It does so by implementing a series of pilot actions with a group of advisors called HEAs (Home Energy Advisors).;
;While the conservation Behaviour of people with high biospheric values has been largely studied in the literature, little is known about the response of these individuals to peer comparison.;These advisors have been specfically trained to implement the pilot actions by educating vulnerable consumers to optimize, andpossibly recuce, their energy consumption, mostly through behavioural changes.;
;In this paper we test the effect of social comparison on energy conservation and whether this depends on the extent to which individuals endorse high environmental values.;In this project, the Energy ConsumptionResearch Institute is responsible for the technical training of HEAs and for planning th;
