The influence of social information on behaviour has been demonstrated in a variety of settings.;The influence of social information on behaviour has been demonstrated in a variety of settings.;Energy poverty is one of the main social, technical and legislative issues at the present time in Europe, with the estimated number of people who are affected ranging from 50 to 125 million.;Energy Poverty is one of the main social, technical and legislative issues of the present time in Europe, with an estimated number of affected people ranging from 50 to 125 million.
For example, research indicates that telling people how their actions compare with those of other, similar people encourages them to modify their energy and water consumption, their contributions to charitable causes, and their savings decisions.;Research shows that telling people how their actions compare with those of similar others leads them to modify their energy and water consumption, their contributions to charitable causes, and their saving decisions.;The European Commission (EC) has put a great deal of effort into solving this issue, as shown, for example, by the recent launch of the EU Energy Poverty Observatory in January 2018.;The European Commission (EC) has put a lot of effort to solve this issue, as shown, for example, by the recent launch of the EU Energy Poverty Observatory in January 2018.
Despite a growing interest in social comparison research, though, several questions remain open.;Despite growing interest in social comparison research, several open questions remain.;One of the points stressed by the EC is the importance of learning from experience and from the best practices being carried out in various member states (MS).;One the points stressed by the EC is the importance to learn from the experiences and best practices carried out in the different Members states (MS).
In particular, relatively little is known about the sources of the heterogeneity observed in the effects of classic social comparison experiments, such as Opower's Home Electricity Report (HER) program.;In particular, relatively little is known about the sources of heterogeneity in the effect of a well-known experiment of social comparison, such as the one provided by the Opower program through the Home Electricity Report.;With this in mind, the project reported here (funded by the EU Commission under Grant Agreement no. 12345), of which the Energy Consumption Research Institute is a partner, aims to uncover best practices and recommendations to address energy poverty.;With this in mind, the project (funded by EU Commission under Grant Agreement n. 12345), of which Energy Consumption Research Institute is a partner, aims to find some best practices and recommendations to address Energy Poverty from the implementation of a series of pilot actions with a group of advisors (called HEAs - Home Energy Advisors).
In our paper, we hypothesize that an important source of the heterogeneous effects observed in the Opower peer comparison might be consumers' environmental values.;In our paper we speculate that environmental values represent an important source of heterogeneity in the effect of the Opower peer comparison.;It does so by implementing a series of pilot actions with a group of advisors called HEAs (Home Energy Advisors).;Such advisors are specifically trained to implement the pilot actions by educating energy vulnerable consumers (VCs) to optimize (and, possibly, reduce) their energy consumption, mostly through behavioural changes.
While the conservation behaviour of people with high biospheric values has been well- documented in the literature, little is known about these consumers' responses to peer comparison.;While the conservation behaviour of people with high biospheric values has been largely studied in the literature, little is known about the response of these individuals to peer comparison.;These advisors have been specifically trained to implement the pilot actions by educating vulnerable consumers to optimize, and possibly reduce, their energy consumption, mostly through behavioural changes.;In the project, Energy Consumption Research Institute is responsible of the technical training of HEAs and the pilot actions planning.
In this paper, we test whether there is an effect of social comparison on energy conservation and whether this effect depends on the extent to which individuals endorse high environmental values.;In this paper we test the effect of social comparison on energy conservation and whether this depends on the extent to which individuals endorse high environmental values.;In this project, the Energy Consumption Research Institute is responsible for the technical training of HEAs and for planning the pilot actions.;This paper collects the first results of the above mentioned tasks.
Another important gap in research is the understanding of the mechanisms behind individuals' reactions to Opower's HER with regard to their energy use.;Another important gap in research is the understanding of the mechanisms behind individuals' reaction to the Opower Home Energy Report (HER) in the field of energy use.;This paper presents the initial results of these two tasks.;"The first part of the paper summarizes the results of a statistical analysis performed to understand how to define an ""energy poor"" or ""energy vulnerable"" consumer, as a common European definition does not exist."
The HER contains different elements, including a static neighbour comparison of energy consumption levels (a descriptive norm), feedback on individual performance (an injunctive norm), as well as energy saving tips.;The HER delivers different elements, from a static neighbour comparison on energy consumption (descriptive norm), to feedbacks on how well an individual is performing (injunctive norm), as well as energy saving tips.;"The first part of the paper summarizes the results of a statistical analysis performed in order to define ""energy-poor"" or ""energy-vulnerable"" consumers, as a common European definition does not exist.";"The main obstacle in performing this analysis is that the data often used for standard indicators (e.g. Low-Income High-Costs) are not available in many countries, so new ways to understand what is an ""energy vulnerable consumer"" have to be explored."
A further objective of this paper is to assess possible mechanisms to make the HER more effective.;A second objective of this paper is to test possible mechanisms that make the HER effective.;The main obstacle in performing this analysis is that the data often used for standard indicators (e.g. Low Income High Costs) are not available in many countries, so new ways to define energy-vulnerable consumers have to be explored.;"Moreover, the availability of different data in the EU countries leads to a fragmented and often ""not compatible"" segmentation in different Member States."
First, we test whether the HER shapes individuals' perceptions of norms in the domain of energy conservation.;First, we test if the HER shapes individuals' perceptions of the norm in the domain of energy conservation.;Moreover, the differences in the data available in EU countries lead to fragmented and often incompatible consumer segmentation in the member states.;To overcome this barrier, it is necessary to define the background in which the pilot actions shall be inserted (the situation in the analysed MS) and to perform an on-purpose segmentation, by analysing and elaborating existing statistics databases to which apply similar indicators, compatible with the available information.
A stronger perception of the norm to conserve energy may then influence energy consumption.;A stronger perception of the norm in the direction of energy conservation may then influence energy consumption.;To overcome this barrier, it is necessary to define the background against which the pilot actions are to be implemented (the situation in the MS analysed) and to perform a targeted market segmentation by analyzing and enhancing existing databases to which similar and compatible indicators are applicable.;The second part of the paper briefly introduces the training that will be proposed to the HEAs, in order to show which competences are required to an HEA who wants to approach a vulnerable consumer/family and how to build them.
While environmental values tend to be stable throughout people's lives, environmental self-identity can be influenced, for example by information regarding energy conservation.;Second, while environmental values tend to be stable in everyone's life, environmental self-identity can be influenced, for example, through information regarding energy conservation.;The second part of the paper briefly introduces the training offered to the HEAs, in order to show which competences an HEA needs before approaching a vulnerable consumer or family, and how to build these competences.;The third part represents the core of the paper, focusing on the planning of the pilot actions.
A second mechanism could therefore be that the information delivered with the HER enhances consumers' environmental self-identity.;A second mechanism could therefore be that the information delivered in the HER increases one's environmental self-identity.;The third part represents the core of the paper, which focuses on planning the pilot actions.;This process has involved several stakeholders, through the organization of three workshops with local experts and stakeholders, massive literature reviews, a brainstorming with several project partners and consultancy with organizations that have already put in place vulnerable consumers actions or are actively working in the social field.
By activating biospheric values, the HER strengthens consumers' focus on benefiting the environment.;By activating biospheric values, the HER strengthens people's focus on benefiting the environment.;This process involved several stakeholders and local experts, who met in three workshops, as well as a comprehensive literature review, brainstorming sessions with several project partners and consultations with organizations that have already put into place actions to support vulnerable consumers or are actively working in this field.;The proposed actions are assessed by analysing their pros and cons, constraints and the time and cost forecast for each of them.
This analysis combines data from a large randomized program conducted by Opower in Italy with survey data collected from utility customers.;The analysis combines data from a large randomized program conducted by Opower in Italy, with survey data collected among utility customers.;The proposed actions are assessed by analyzing their advantages and disadvantages, their possible constraints as well as the projected timeframe and cost forecast for each of them.;Finally, the outcomes of the first implemented actions are presented to give an insight of the preliminary results.
The data received from the utility company specify whether a person receives an HER that includes social information, the frequency and type of social information, customers' engagement with it, and their energy consumption.;The data available from the utility details whether a person receives the social information through the Home Energy Report, the frequency and type of social information, customers' engagement with it and energy consumption.;Finally, the outcomes of the first implemented actions are presented in order to provide insights into the preliminary results.;The main conclusions that can be drawn are focused on the role of the Home Energy Advisor and on the energy consumption optimization that can be triggered by their advice to vulnerable consumers.
The survey data include measures of environmental values, environmental self-identity, social norms and other household characteristics.;Survey data includes measures of environmental values, environmental self-identity, social norms and other household characteristics.;The main conclusions that can be drawn focus on the role of the Home Energy Advisors and on optimized energy consumption, which can be triggered by HEA advice to vulnerable consumers.;The first issue is related to the barriers that have to be overcome by the HEAs.
The first objective of this analysis is an evaluation of the impact that the HER program has on energy consumption and on customers' engagement with the digital HER portal.;The first objective of the analysis is the impact evaluation of the HER program on energy consumption and digital engagement with the portal.;In general, two issues have been identified.;In particular, the education background barrier has shown to be a pre-requisite for the success of the training.
The empirical analysis is based on a sample of customers of an Italian utility company (ENI gas e luce) between January 2015 and December 2017.;The empirical analysis is conducted on a sample of customers of an Italian utility company (ENI gas and Luce), for the time period ranging from January 2015 to December 2017.;The first is related to the barriers that have to be overcome by the HEAs.;"And the ""trust"" barrier towards energy vulnerable consumers needs to be clearly established by showing that HEAs act as a ""third party"" with no economic interest, e.g. a national consumer association or a local charity."
The sample consists of 4'535 customers, 3'720 of whom belong to the treatment group while 815 constitute the control group.;The sample consists in 4'535 customers, of which 3'720 and 815 from the treatment and control group, respectively.;In particular, adapting to differences in educational background has been shown to be a pre-requisite for the success of the training.;"This is also related to the last barrier, that concerns the possibility to use the ""HEA qualification"" on the job market."
A second objective of this paper is to assess the heterogeneous effects of the program along two dimensions.;A second objective of the paper is to assess the heterogeneous effects of the program along two dimensions.;Any lack of trust that energy-vulnerable consumers have in HEAs can be countered by showing that they are acting as independent parties with no economic interest (e.g. a national consumer association or a local charity).;The second issue is that, in many cases, it is almost impossible to reduce energy consumption of the energy vulnerable households.
We aim to test how treatment effects vary with respect to pre-treatment energy consumption as well as baseline environmental values.;We aim to test how treatment effects vary with respect to pre-treatment energy consumption as well as baseline environmental values.;"This is also related to another barrier, which concerns the possibility of using the ""HEA qualification"" on the job market.";"In fact, unaware of the energy-related benefits, they are already behaving in an ""energy saving"" mode and consuming as little energy as possible, in order to reduce their expenses."
This analysis aims to answer the question of which characteristics make customers more likely to respond to the information in the HER.;This analysis aims to answer the question on which customers' characteristics make them more likely to respond to the HER communication.;The second issue is that, in many cases, it is nearly impossible to reduce energy consumption in energy-vulnerable households.;Therefore, the HEAs should only aim to optimize VCs energy consumption in order to reduce or maintain their current level of expenses, while consuming the same amount of energy (or more, thus increasing their comfort).
A third objective of the study is to answer the question about the mechanisms behind the effects of the program.;A third objective of the study is the question on the mechanisms behind the effect of the program.;Although unaware of the environmental benefits, they already behave in an energy-saving mode and consume as little energy as possible in order to keep their expenses low.;"This can be done by using energy in a ""smarter"" way, for example, by exploiting the different electricity price at different time of the day or by switching to a more convenient energy provider, with the help of the external experts, such as the HEAs."
To shed light on the roles of two possible mechanisms, we conduct manipulation checks.;To shed light on the role of two possible mechanisms, we conduct manipulation checks.;The HEAs should therefore only aim to optimize energy consumption in terms of reducing or maintaining vulnerable consumers' current level of expenses with the same amount of energy (or slightly more, thus increasing their comfort).;
We first test whether the information received via the HER affects environmental self-identity.;We first test if the communication received through the eHER affects environmental self-identity.;"This can be achieved by using energy in a ""smarter"" way, for example by exploiting different electricity prices at different times of the day or by switching to a more inexpensive energy provider with the help of external experts such as the HEAs.";
We also test whether the HER influences consumers' perception of social norms related to energy conservation.;We also test if HER influences a perception of the social norm related to energy conservation.;;
A very robust finding of the analysis is that pre-treatment energy usage and environmental values are the major sources of heterogeneity. ;A very robust finding of the analysis is that pre-treatment usage along with environmental values are the major sources of heterogeneity.;;
Families with higher pre-treatment consumption respond to the intervention by curbing energy consumption.;Families with higher pre-consumption respond to the intervention by curbing energy consumption.;;
If they have high pre-treatment consumption, people who strongly endorse environmental values are more likely to respond to the social information by cutting energy consumption.;Conditional on high pre-consumption, people who strongly endorse environmental values, are more likely to respond to the social information by cutting energy consumption.;;
Furthermore, the HER increases environmental self-identity among people with high pre-treatment consumption.;Second, the HER increases environmental self-identity among people with high pre-consumption.;;
Another important result is that the HER increases consumers' perception in favour of the social norm of energy conservation.;Another important result is that the HER increases the perception of the social norm in favour of energy conservation.;;
Interestingly, this effect holds for both high-consumption and low-consumption households.;Interestingly, this effect holds for both high-consumption and low-consumption households.;;
Taking all these results together, we can infer that the HER encourages high pre-treatment consumption households to reduce their home energy consumption because the HER increases their environmental self-identity.;Taking all these results together, one can infer that high pre-consumption households are induced to reduce home energy consumption by the HER because the HER increases their environmental self-identity.;;
The HER also influences the social norm of energy conservation among low pre-treatment consumption households but this effect does not translate into lower energy consumption among this type of families.;On the contrary, the HER influences the social norm among low pre-consumption households but this effect does not translate in lower energy consumption among this type of families.;;
We can therefore argue that the social norm mechanism is less effective in promoting energy-conserving behaviour.;One can therefore argue that the social norm mechanism is less effective in conducting a final outcome in terms of energy conservation.;;
